# loops

- In python there are two major loops `while` and `for`.
- loop statements repeatedly execute instructions until a goal is achieved.
- The `while` loop is typically used for condition based executions.
- The `for` loop is used for count-controlled executions. 
- Example of the `while` and `for` loops are below.
```python
while balance < TARGET :
    interest = balance * RATE / 100 
    balance = balance + interest
//TODO: add code for for loop here    
```

## The `while` loop
- A while loop can be controlled by a counter like this.
```python
counter = 1 # Initialize the counter.
while counter <= 10 : # Check the counter.
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1 # Update the loop variable.
```

### The `while` loop examples

Example # 1
```python
i= 0
total = 0
while total < 0 :
    i = i+ 1
    total = total - i
    print(i, total)
```
There is no output because total < 0 is false.

Example # 2
```python
i= 0
total = 0
while total >= 10 :
    i=i+ 1
    total = total + i
    print(i, total)  
```
There is no output because total >= 0 is false.

Example # 3
```python
i= 0
total = 0
while total >= 0 :
    i=i+ 1
    total = total + i print(i, total)
print(i, total)      
```
There is no output and program doesn't terminate, because the loop runs
forever and print statement is outside the while loop because of it's indentation.

## Infinite loops

- A common reason for infinite loops is forgetting to update the variable that controls the loop.
- Another common reason for an infinite loop is accidentally incrementing a counter that should be decremented.

```python
# Scenario - 1
year = 1
while year <= 20 :
    interest = balance * RATE / 100 
    balance = balance + interest

#Scenario - 2
year = 20
while year > 0 :
    interest = balance * RATE / 100 
    balance = balance + interest 
    year = year + 1
```

## Sentinel values

- when reading a sequence of inputs, there should be some method of indicating the end of the sequence.
- Such a value, which is not an actual input, but serves as a signal for termination, is called a sentinel.
- If the input is non-negative, typically `-1` is used to terminate the loop.
- If the input is a string, typically `Q` or `Enter key` is used.
```python
# Negative sentinel value
while salary >= 0.0 :
    salary = float(input("Enter a salary or -1 to finish: ")) 
    if salary >= 0.0 :
        total = total + salary 
        count = count + 1

# Q Sentinel value
inputStr = input("Enter a value or Q to quit: ") 
while inputStr != "Q" :
    value = float(inputStr)
    # Process value.
    inputStr = input("Enter a value or Q to quit: ")

# Enter key sentinel value
name = input("Enter a name or press the Enter key to quit: ") 
while name != "" :
    # Process value
    inputStr = input("Enter a name or press the Enter key to quit: ")            
```

### Redirection of input and output
- Write the below program into a file say `sentinel.py`
```python
# Initialize variables to maintain the running total and count. total = 0.0
count = 0
# Initialize salary to any non-sentinel value. 
salary = 0.0
# Process data until the sentinel is entered. 
while salary >= 0.0 :
    salary = float(input("Enter a salary or -1 to finish: ")) if salary >= 0.0 :
    total = total + salary count = count + 1
# Compute and print the average salary. 
if count > 0 :
    average = total / count
    print("Average salary is", average) 
else :
    print("No data was entered.")
```
- The program `sentinel.py` can take input sequence from a file `numbers.txt` with all values in it
  and write the output to another file, use the below command.
```
python sentinel.py < numbers.txt > output.txt
```

## Common loop algorithms

- Computing the sum of a number of inputs is a very common task.
```python
total = 0.0
count = 0
inputStr = input("Enter value: ") 
while inputStr != "":
    value = float(inputStr)
    total = total + value
    count = count + 1
    inputStr = input("Enter value: ")
if count > 0:
    average = total / count
else:
    average = 0.0
```
- Comparing adjacent values is also a common task.
```python
value = int(input("Enter a value: ")) 
inputStr = input("Enter a value: ") 
while inputStr != "" :
    previous = value
    value = int(inputStr) 
    if value == previous :
        print("Duplicate input") 
    inputStr = input("Enter a value: ")
```

# The `for` loop

- The `for` loop is used to iterate over the contents of any container.
  For ex, to iterate over the characters of a string
```
stateName = "Virginia" 
for letter in stateName:
    print(letter)

The for loop prints the below output:

V
i 
r 
g 
i 
n 
i 
a    
```

- Python provides the range function for generating a sequence of integers 
  that can be used with the for loop as below.
```
for i in range(1, 10):  # i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 
    print(i)

# By default range function starts at zero.
for i in range(10) :  # i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 
    print("Hello")    

# To increment the loop by 2
for i in range(1, 10, 2) :  # i = 1, 3, 5, ..., 9 
    print(i)

# To decrement the loop
for i in range(5, 0, -1) :  # i = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    print(i)        
```

## Count iterations with `for` loop

- To count the no of iterations in a `for` loop
```
# i traverses from 0 to len(str) - 1
for i in range(0, len(str)) : 
    print(i)
    print(str[i])
```

## Nested loops

- Complex iterations sometimes require a nested loop; a loop inside another loop.
- When processing tables, nested loops occur.
- For ex, to print a table of powers of say x.
```
##
# This program prints a table of powers of x.
#

# Initialize constant variables for the max ranges.
NMAX = 4
XMAX = 10

# Print table header.
for n in range(1, NMAX + 1):
    print("%10d" % n, end="")

print()

for n in range(1, NMAX + 1):
    print("%10s" % "x ", end="")

print("\n", " ", "-" * 40)
# Print table body.
for x in range(1, XMAX + 1):
    # Print the x row in the table.
    for n in range(1, NMAX + 1):
        print("%10.0f" % x ** n, end="")

    print()
```
- Python provides a special form of the print function that prevents it from starting new line.
  The format is `print(value1, value2, . . ., valuen, end="")`. For ex,
```
print("00", end="") 
print(3 + 4)

O/P: 007
```

## Processing strings

- For counting no of vowels in a string
````
vowels = 0
for char in word :
  if char.lower() in "aeiou": 
    vowels = vowels + 1
print(vowels)    
````
- To find the uppercase letters and position
````
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ") 
for i in range(len(sentence)):
  if sentence[i].isupper(): 
    print(i)
````
- To find the first digit match in a string
````
found = False
position = 0
while not found and position < len(string):
  if string[position].isdigit():
    found = True 
  else:
    position = position + 1
if found :
  print("First digit occurs at position", position)
else :
  print("The string does not contain a digit.")
````
- To find the last digit match in a string
````
found = False
position = len(string) - 1
while not found and position >= 0: 
  if string[position].isdigit():
    found = True 
  else:
    position = position - 1
````

## Validating string

- To valid a us phone number using the format (###)###-####
````
valid = len(string) == 13
position = 0
while valid and position < len(string):
  valid = ((position == 0 and string[position] == "(")
    or (position == 4 and string[position] == ")")
    or (position == 8 and string[position] == "-")
    or (position != 0 and position != 4 and position != 8
    and string[position].isdigit())) 
  position = position + 1
````

## Random numbers
- The Python library has a random number generator that produces numbers that appear to be completely random.
- The `random()` function yields a random floating-point number that is â‰¥ 0 and < 1.
````
from random import random
for i in range(10): 
  value = random() 
  print(value)
````
