# loops

- In python there are two major loops `while` and `for`.
- loop statements repeatedly execute instructions until a goal is achieved.
- The `while` loop is typically used for condition based executions.
- The `for` loop is used for count-controlled executions. 
- Example of the `while` and `for` loops are below.
```
while balance < TARGET :
    interest = balance * RATE / 100 
    balance = balance + interest
//TODO: add code for for loop here    
```

## The `while` loop
- A while loop can be controlled by a counter like this.
```
counter = 1 # Initialize the counter.
while counter <= 10 : # Check the counter.
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1 # Update the loop variable.
```

### The `while` loop examples

```
Example # 1
i= 0
total = 0
while total < 0 :
    i = i+ 1
    total = total - i print(i, total)

There is no output because total < 0 is false.

Example # 2

i= 0
total = 0
while total >= 10 :
    i=i+ 1
    total = total + i print(i, total)  

There is no output because total >= 0 is false.

Example # 3

i= 0
total = 0
while total >= 0 :
    i=i+ 1
    total = total + i print(i, total)
print(i, total)      

There is no output and program doesn't terminate, because the loop runs
forever and print statement is outside the while loop.
