# Dictionaries

- A dictionary is a container that keeps associations between keys and values.
  - Keys are unique, but a value may be associated with several keys.
  - The dictionary structure is also known as a map because it maps a unique key to a value.
  - To create an empty dictionary `emptyDict = {}`.
  - To create a small dictionary for a contact list that contains four items:
    `contacts = { "Fred": 7235591, "Mary": 3841212, "Bob": 3841212, "Sarah": 2213278 }`
  - Each key/value pair is separated by a colon like json.  

## Accessing dictionary

- The subscript operator [] is used to return the value associated with a key. For ex:
````
print("Fred's number is", contacts["Fred"])
````
- The key supplied to the subscript operator must be a valid key in the dictionary or a 
  KeyError exception will be raised.
- To verify if a key is present in the dictionary:
```
if "John" in contacts :
    print("John's number is", contacts["John"])
else :
    print("John is not in my contact list.")
```
- To return a default value if key is not present use `get` method.
```
number = contacts.get("Fred", 411) 
print("Dial " + number)
```

## Adding and Modifying items

- To add a new item to a dictionary `contacts["John"] = 4578102`.
- To modify value associated with a given key `contacts["John"] = 2228102`.

## Removing items

- To remove an item `contacts.pop("Fred")`. This raises KeyError if key is not present.
  Verify using `in` operator before removing an item.

## Traversing

- To iterate over keys:
```
print("My Contacts:") 
for key in contacts :
  print(key)

O/P:
My Contacts: 
Sarah
Bob
John
Mary 
Fred  
``` 
- To iterate over keys and values at the same time is efficient:
````
print("My Contacts:") 
for key in contacts :
    print("%-10s %d" % (key, contacts[key]))

O/P:
My Contacts:
Sarah 2213278 
Bob   3841212 
John  4578102 
Mary  3841212 
Fred  7235591    
````
- The `items` method returns a sequence of tuples that contains keys and values of 
  all items.
````
for item in contacts.items() : 
    print(item[0], item[1])

# Alternatively, we can use tuple assignment.
for (key, value) in contacts.items() : 
    print(key, value)    
````  
- If we want to iterate over keys in sorted order use `for key in sorted(contacts) :`.
- We can also iterate over values:
````
phoneNumbers = [] # Create an empty list. 
for number in contacts.values() :
    phoneNumbers.append(number)
````
- The easiest way to prepare a list out of values is `phoneNumbers = list(contacts.values())`.

# Complext structures

## A dictionary of sets

- Suppose we want to do the task of building a book index from page numbers and terms 
  contained in a text file with the following format:
````
6:type 
7:example 
7:index
7:program 
8:type 
10:example 
11:program 
20:set
...
````
- The output of the program should be a list of terms in alphabetical order followed 
  by the page numbers on which the term occurs, separated by commas, like this:
````
example: 7, 10 
index: 7 
program: 7, 11 
type: 6, 8 
set: 20
````
- The most practical solution for the above problem would be a dictionary of sets. 
  Each key can be a term and its corresponding value a set of the page numbers where
  it occurs.
  - The terms in the index must be unique. By making each term a dictionary key, there
    will be only one instance of each term.
  - The index listing must be provided in alphabetical order by term. We can iterate
    over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order to produce the listing.
  - Duplicate page numbers for a term should only be included once. By adding each 
    page number to a set, we ensure that no duplicates will be added.
- The complete solution can be found in the source file `buildindex.py`.

## A Dictionary of Lists

- Consider the problem of extracting data from a text file that represents the 
  yearly sales of different ice cream flavors in multiple stores of a retail 
  ice cream company.
````
vanilla:8580.0:7201.25:8900.0 
chocolate:10225.25:9025.0:9505.0 
rocky road:6700.1:5012.45:6011.0 
strawberry:9285.15:8276.1:8705.0 
cookie dough:7901.25:4267.0:7056.5
````
- The data is to be processed to produce a report similar to the following:
````
chocolate       10225.25  9025.00  9505.00  28755.25
cookie dough    7901.25   4267.00  7056.50  19224.75
rocky road      6700.10   5012.45  6011.00  17723.55
strawberry      9285.15   8276.10  8705.00  26266.25
vanilla         8580.00   7201.25  8900.00  24681.25
               42691.75  33781.80 40177.50
````
- The report includes the sales of each flavor of ice cream in each store with the 
  flavors listed in alphabetical order. 
- The total sales by flavor and by store is also included.
- We use dictionary of lists to store this kind of data.  
  - With this structure, each row of the table is an item in the dictionary.
  - The name of the ice cream flavor is the key used to identify a particular row in 
    the table.
  - The value for each key is a list that contains the sales, by store, for that 
    flavor of ice cream.
- A complete solution that prints the data in the tabular format above is provided
  in the source file `icecreamsales.py`.
