# Abstract classes
- Abstract classes in Python are a way to define classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are meant to be subclassed. 
- Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. 
- This concept is similar to interfaces and abstract classes in other object-oriented programming languages like Java.
- Python provides the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module to implement abstract classes.

## Key Concepts

- `Abstract Base Class (ABC):` A class that contains one or more abstract methods.
- `Abstract Method:` A method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Subclasses are required to override these methods.

Here is a step-by-step guide to creating an abstract class in Python:

- Import the abc Module
  - Need to import ABC and abstractmethod from the abc module.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
```
- Define the Abstract Base Class
```python
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop_engine(self):
        pass
```
- Define Concrete Subclasses
  - Concrete subclasses must implement all abstract 
    methods from the abstract base class.
```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Car engine started")

    def stop_engine(self):
        print("Car engine stopped")

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Motorcycle engine started")

    def stop_engine(self):
        print("Motorcycle engine stopped")
```
- Instantiate concrete subclasses, but not the abstract 
  base class.
```python
car = Car()
car.start_engine()   # Output: Car engine started
car.stop_engine()    # Output: Car engine stopped

motorcycle = Motorcycle()
motorcycle.start_engine()  # Output: Motorcycle engine started
motorcycle.stop_engine()   # Output: Motorcycle engine stopped

# The following will raise an error:
# vehicle = Vehicle()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods start_engine, stop_engine
```

## Abstract properties
- We can define abstract properties in the abstract base class as 
  shown below.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    @property
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    @property
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound)  # Output: Bark

cat = Cat()
print(cat.sound)  # Output: Meow
```

### When to use abstract base classes?

- `Enforcing a Contract:` Abstract base classes ensure that any subclass will implement the abstract methods. This enforces a consistent interface across different subclasses.
- `Code Organization:` They help in organizing code by grouping related methods that subclasses must implement.
- `Polymorphism:` Abstract base classes allow you to use polymorphism, where you can use objects of different classes through a common interface.
