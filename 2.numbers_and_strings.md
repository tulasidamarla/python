# Variables

- Variables are used to store values.
- variable is a storage location in a program.
  - It is similar to a parking space in a parking garage. The parking space has an identifier say "J041",
    and it can hold a vehicle. Similarly, a variable has a name and it can hold a value.

## Variable names

- When a variable is defined, it is better to give a name that explains its purpose. 
- Variable name in Python must follow a few simple rules:
  - Names must start with a letter or the underscore (_) character, 
    and the remaining characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores.
  - Names Cannot have other symbols such as ? or %. 
  - Spaces are not permitted inside names. 
  - Use uppercase letters to denote word boundaries, as in cansPerPack(camel case convention).  
  - names are case-sensitive.
  - Reserved words like if, else, switch etc cannot be used.

## Constants

- A constant variable, or simply a constant, is a variable whose value 
  should not be changed after it has been assigned an initial value.
- Some languages provide an explicit mechanism for marking a variable as a 
  constant and will generate a syntax error if you attempt to assign a 
  new value to the variable.
- Python leaves it to the programmer to make sure that constants are not changed.
- It is common practice specifying a constant variable with the use of all 
  capital letters for its name. For ex `BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2.0`.
  
## Variables program
- Let's take an example to illustrate variables.
  - Soft drinks are sold in cans and bottles. A store offers six-pack of 12-ounce(.355 litres)
    cans in for the same price as 2 litre bottles. which one should we buy?
    
```
# Liters in a 12-ounce can and a two-liter bottle. 
CAN_VOLUME = 0.355
BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2.0

# Number of cans per pack. 
cansPerPack = 6

# Calculate total volume in the cans.
totalVolume = cansPerPack * CAN_VOLUME
print("A six-pack of 12-ounce cans contains", totalVolume, "liters.")

# Calculate total volume in the cans and a 2-liter bottle.
totalVolume = totalVolume + BOTTLE_VOLUME
print("A six-pack and a two-liter bottle contain", totalVolume, "liters.")
```

- `cansPerPack = 6` the left-hand side of the assignment consists of a variable. 
  The right-hand side is an expression that has a value.
- After a variable has been defined, it can be used in other statements. 
  For example, `print(cansPerPack)`.
- If an existing variable is assigned a new value, that value replaces the previous 
  contents of the variable. For example, `cansPerPack = 8`.
- It is perfectly legal to write `cansPerPack = cansPerPack + 2`. It means to 
  look up the value stored in the variable cansPerPack, add 2 to it, 
  and place the result back into cansPerPack.

## Data types
  
- The data-type of a value determines how the data is represented in the computer and what operations can be performed on that data.
- A data type provided by the language itself is called a primitive data type.
- Python supports quite a few data types: numbers, text strings, files, containers, and many others.
- Programmers can also define their own user-defined data types.

### Number types  
- There are several types of numbers.
- An integer value is a whole number without a fractional part.
- A float value is a number with a fractional part, such as .355.
- A variable in Python can store a value of any type.
  - The data type is associated with the value, not the variable. For example, 
    consider this variable that is initialized with a value of type int:
    `taxRate = 5`.
  - The same variable can later hold a value of type float:
    `taxRate = 5.5`.  
  - It could even hold a string:
    `taxRate = "Non-taxable"` # Not recommended
- once a variable is initialized with a value of a particular type, 
  it's a good practice to keep the same type in that variable.    
  
# Arithmetic calculations

## Basic arithmetic operations

- Python supports four arithmetic operations as a calculator-addition(+),
  subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/).
- The symbols + - * / for the arithmetic operations are called operators. 
- The combination of variables, literals, operators, and parentheses is called 
  an expression. For ex, `(a + b) / 2` is an expression.
- Parentheses are used just as in algebra: to indicate in which order 
  the parts of the expression should be computed. 
- As in algebra, operators with the same precedence are executed left-to-right.
  For ex, `10 - 2 - 3 is 8 – 3 or 5`.

## Powers

- Python uses the exponential operator ** to denote the power operation. For ex,
  the expression a<sup>2</sup> is a ** 2.
- The exponential operator has a higher order of precedence than the other 
  arithmetic operators.
- Unlike the other arithmetic operators, power operators are evaluated 
  from right to left. For ex, expression 10 ** 2 ** 3 is equivalent to 
  10<sup>(2<sup>3</sup>)</sup> = 10<sup>8</sup>.
- In Python, you have to write all expressions in a linear arrangement. 
  For example, the mathematical expression b×(1+ r/100)<sup>n</sup> becomes
  b * (1 + r/100) ** n.

## Floor division and remainder

- In python, when two integers are divided with the / operator, a floating-point 
  value. For example, 7/ 4 yields 1.75.
- The floor division in python 7 // 4 returns 1 by discarding the fraction 0.75.
- The expression  7 % 4 returns the remainder 3. This operator `%` is also called
  `modulo` or simply `mod`.

## Built-in functions

- To return absolute value use abs() function. For ex, abs(-173) returns 173.
- The function round(7.625) returns 7, whereas round(7.625, 2) returns 7.63.
- There are built-in mathematical functions like max(x1,x2, ..., xn), 
  min(x1,x2, ...,xn)
  
## Mathematical functions

- Python contains a standard library that can be used to create powerful programs.
- A library is a collection of code that has been written and translated which
  is ready to use in the programs.
- Python's standard library is organized into modules.
- Related functions and data types are grouped into the same module.
- Functions defined in a module must be explicitly loaded into your program before they can be used.
- Python’s math module includes a number of mathematical functions.
- To use any function from this module, it must be imported. For ex, to use
  sqrt() function,
```
from math import sqrt
y = sqrt(x)
```  
- Here is a list of important math functions

```
sqrt(x)     - The square root of x. (x ≥ 0)
trunc(x)    - Truncates floating-point value x to an integer.
cos(x)      - The cosine of x in radians. similary sin and tan also available.
exp(x)      - e^x
degrees(x)  - Convert x radians to degrees (i.e., returns x · 180/π)
radians(x)  - Convert x degrees to radians (i.e., returns x · π /180)
log(x)      - The natural logarithm of x (to base e)
log(x, base)- The logarithm of x to the given base.

```

## Round-off errors

- If 1/3 is calculated to two decimal places, it returns 0.33. Multiplying
  0.33 by 3 returns 0.99, not 1.00.
- Processor hardware uses binary number system using digits 0 and 1. Similar to 
  decimal system round off errors may occur when binary digits are lost. For ex,
```
price = 4.35
quantity = 100
total = price * quantity # Should be 100 * 4.35 = 435 
print(total) # Prints 434.99999999999994
```  
- Round-off errors can be dealt by rounding to the nearest integer or 
  by displaying a fixed number of digits after the decimal separator. 

## Other Ways to Import Modules

- `from math import sqrt, sin, cos` to import multiple functions.
- `from math import *` to import all functions.
- `import math` simplest of all, but to invoke use module name as in `math.sqrt(x)`.

## Line joining

- If an expression is too long to fit on a single line, it can be continued to
  another line provided the line break occurs inside parenthesis. For ex,
```
x1 = ((-b + sqrt(b ** 2 - 4 * a * c)) 
/ (2 * a)) # Ok
```
- If the last character of a line is a backslash, the line is joined with 
  the one following it:
```
x1 = (-b + sqrt(b ** 2 - 4 * a * c)) \ 
/ (2 * a) # Ok

```

# Strings
