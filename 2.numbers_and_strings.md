# Variables

- Variables are used to store values.
- variable is a storage location in a program.
  - It is similar to a parking space in a parking garage. The parking space has an identifier say "J041",
    and it can hold a vehicle. Similarly, a variable has a name and it can hold a value.

## Variable names

- When a variable is defined, it is better to give a name that explains its purpose. 
- Variable name in Python must follow a few simple rules:
  - Names must start with a letter or the underscore (_) character, 
    and the remaining characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores.
  - Names Cannot have other symbols such as ? or %. 
  - Spaces are not permitted inside names. 
  - Use uppercase letters to denote word boundaries, as in cansPerPack(camel case convention).  
  - names are case-sensitive.
  - Reserved words like if, else, switch etc cannot be used.

## Constants

- A constant variable, or simply a constant, is a variable whose value 
  should not be changed after it has been assigned an initial value.
- Some languages provide an explicit mechanism for marking a variable as a 
  constant and will generate a syntax error if you attempt to assign a 
  new value to the variable.
- Python leaves it to the programmer to make sure that constants are not changed.
- It is common practice specifying a constant variable with the use of all 
  capital letters for its name. For ex `BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2.0`.
  
## Variables program
- Let's take an example to illustrate variables.
  - Soft drinks are sold in cans and bottles. A store offers six-pack of 12-ounce(.355 litres)
    cans in for the same price as 2 litre bottles. which one should we buy?
    
```
# Liters in a 12-ounce can and a two-liter bottle. 
CAN_VOLUME = 0.355
BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2.0

# Number of cans per pack. 
cansPerPack = 6

# Calculate total volume in the cans.
totalVolume = cansPerPack * CAN_VOLUME
print("A six-pack of 12-ounce cans contains", totalVolume, "liters.")

# Calculate total volume in the cans and a 2-liter bottle.
totalVolume = totalVolume + BOTTLE_VOLUME
print("A six-pack and a two-liter bottle contain", totalVolume, "liters.")
```

- `cansPerPack = 6` the left-hand side of the assignment consists of a variable. 
  The right-hand side is an expression that has a value.
- After a variable has been defined, it can be used in other statements. 
  For example, `print(cansPerPack)`.
- If an existing variable is assigned a new value, that value replaces the previous 
  contents of the variable. For example, `cansPerPack = 8`.
- It is perfectly legal to write `cansPerPack = cansPerPack + 2`. It means to 
  look up the value stored in the variable cansPerPack, add 2 to it, 
  and place the result back into cansPerPack.

## Data types
  
- The data-type of a value determines how the data is represented in the computer and what operations can be performed on that data.
- A data type provided by the language itself is called a primitive data type.
- Python supports quite a few data types: numbers, text strings, files, containers, and many others.
- Programmers can also define their own user-defined data types.

### Number types  
- There are several types of numbers.
- An integer value is a whole number without a fractional part.
- A float value is a number with a fractional part, such as .355.
- A variable in Python can store a value of any type.
  - The data type is associated with the value, not the variable. For example, 
    consider this variable that is initialized with a value of type int:
    `taxRate = 5`.
  - The same variable can later hold a value of type float:
    `taxRate = 5.5`.  
  - It could even hold a string:
    `taxRate = "Non-taxable"` # Not recommended
- once a variable is initialized with a value of a particular type, 
  it's a good practice to keep the same type in that variable.
