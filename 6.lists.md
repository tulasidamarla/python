# Basic properties of lists

## Creating a list

- To create a list in python declare an array like assignment like this
  `values = [32, 54, 67.5, 29, 35, 80, 115, 44.5, 100, 65]`.
  

## Accessing an element

- An element can be access with its index. In python list index start with zero.
- To access an element use the subscript operator `[]` as with accessing char from
  a string. For ex, `values[5]`.
- Attempting to access an element whose index is not within the valid index range 
  is called an out-of-range error or a bounds' error.
- To ensure access list within the legal bounds use the below code.
````
if 0 <= i and i < len(values): 
    values[i] = number
````

### Traversing the list

- There are multiple ways to traverse a list.
````
# traverses with in the range
for i in range(10):
    print(i, values[i])

# traverses the complete list
for i in range(len(values)): 
    print(i, values[i])    

# traversing without index
for element in values: 
    print(element)    
````

### List references

- When a list elements are accessed, it uses the list reference.
- When a list variable is copied into another, both variables refer to the same list.

## Reverse subscripts

- Python, unlike many other languages, also allows using negative subscripts when 
  accessing an element of a list.
- The negative subscripts provide access to the list elements in reverse order.
- For example, a subscript of `â€“1` provides access to the last element in the list.
  Similarly, `-2` is the second-to-last element.
- The valid range of negative subscripts is between -1 and -len(list).
