# Basic properties of lists

## Creating a list

- To create a list in python declare an array like assignment like this
  `values = [32, 54, 67.5, 29, 35, 80, 115, 44.5, 100, 65]`.

## Creating sublists or slices

- Let's take an example of temperatures of each month. 
  ```
  temperatures = [18, 21, 24, 28, 33, 39, 40, 39, 36, 30, 22, 18]
  ```
- To create a sublist from a list use python's slice operator(`:`). 
- The length of the slice `temperatures[a : b]` is the difference b - a.
- For ex, `thirdQuarter = temperatures[6 : 9]`.
- If first index is omitted all elements from the first are included. 
  For ex, `firsthalf = temperatures[ : 6]`.
- If second index is omitted all elements from the index to last element are included.
- If both indexes are omitted, a copy of the list is returned.
- Slices work with all sequences. For ex, strings.
```  
greeting = "Hello, World!"
greeted = greeting[7 : 12] # The substring "World"
```

## Accessing an element

- An element can be access with its index. In python list index start with zero.
- To access an element use the subscript operator `[]` as with accessing char from
  a string. For ex, `values[5]`.
- Attempting to access an element whose index is not within the valid index range 
  is called an out-of-range error or a bounds' error.
- To ensure access list within the legal bounds use the below code.
````
if 0 <= i and i < len(values): 
    values[i] = number
````

### Traversing the list

- There are multiple ways to traverse a list.
````
# traverses with in the range
for i in range(10):
    print(i, values[i])

# traverses the complete list
for i in range(len(values)): 
    print(i, values[i])    

# traversing without index
for element in values: 
    print(element)    
````

### List references

- When a list elements are accessed, it uses the list reference.
- When a list variable is copied into another, both variables refer to the same list.

## Reverse subscripts

- Python, unlike many other languages, also allows using negative subscripts when 
  accessing an element of a list.
- The negative subscripts provide access to the list elements in reverse order.
- For example, a subscript of `â€“1` provides access to the last element in the list.
  Similarly, `-2` is the second-to-last element.
- The valid range of negative subscripts is between -1 and -len(list).

## List operations

- To append an element to the end of a list
````
friends = []
friends.append("Harry")
````
- To insert an element into a list at a specific index
````
friends = ["Harry", "Emily", "Bob", "Cari"]
friends.insert(1, "Cindy")
````
- To find if an element is present in the list
````
if "Cindy" in friends:
    print("She's a friend")
````
- To get the index of an element
````
friends = ["Harry", "Emily", "Bob", "Cari", "Emily"]
n = friends.index("Emily") # Sets n to 1

# To find the index after a starting position
n2 = friends.index("Emily", n + 1) # sets n2 to 4
````
- If an element is not present in the list, `index` method throws an 
  exception. To avoid this test it with `in` operator like below.
````
if "Cindy" in friends:
    n = friends.index("Cindy")
else:
    n = -1
````
- To remove an element use either `pop` or `remove` methods.
  - `pop` method removes based on index.
  - `remove` method removes an element by value instead of by position.  
````
friends = ["Harry", "Cindy", "Emily", "Bob", "Cari", "Bill"]
friends.pop(1)
friends.pop() # removes last element

friends.remove("Cari")
````
- Like `index` method `remove` method also throws exception if element is
  not present in the list. To avoid this test the list like below:
````
element = "Cari"
if element in friends:
    friends.remove(element)
````
- Two lists can be concatenated using `+` operator. For ex,
````
myFriends = ["Fritz", "Cindy"] 
yourFriends = ["Lee", "Pat", "Phuong"]

ourFriends = myFriends + yourFriends
# Sets ourFriends to ["Fritz", "Cindy", "Lee", "Pat", "Phuong"]
````
- To concatenate same list multiple times, use the replication operator(*).
````
monthInQuarter = [1, 2, 3] * 4 
# The list is [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

# To initialize a list with fixed values
monthlyScores = [0] * 12
````
- The equality operators `==` & `!=` can be used to test equality of two lists.
  For ex For example, `[1, 4, 9] == [1, 4, 9]` is True, but 
  `[1, 4, 9 ] == [4, 1, 9]` is False.

### Sum, Min, Max and Sorting

- sum([1, 4, 9, 16]) # Yields 30
- max([1, 16, 9, 4]) # Yields 16
- min(["Fred", "Ann", "Sue"]) # Yields "Ann"
- values = [1, 16, 9, 4]
  - values.sort() # Now values is [1, 4, 9, 16]

### Copying lists using `list` function

- Assigning a list variable to another doesn't copy the list. 
  Both variables reference the same list.
- To copy the list use `list` function. For ex, `prices = list(values)`. Now
  values and prices reference two different lists with same values.
- The `list` function can be used to make a list out of any sequence. For ex,
```
  characters = list("Hello") # The list is ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```
