# Functions

- A function packages a computation consisting of multiple steps into a form that 
  can be easily understood and reused.
- A function is a sequence of instructions with a name.
- Call a function in order to execute its instructions. For ex 
  `price = round(6.8275, 2) # Sets result to 6.83`.
- When another function calls the round function, it provides “inputs”,  
  such as the values 6.8275 and 2. These are called arguments.
- The “output” that the function computes is called the return value.

## Writing a function

- Pick a name for the function
- Define a variable for each argument. These variables are called parameters.
- Here is a function to find the cubeVolume.
````
def cubeVolume(sideLength): 
    volume = sideLength ** 3
    return volume
````

## Programs with multiple functions

- Python interpreter reads each function definition and each statement. 
- The statements in a function definition are not executed until the function is called. 
- Any statement not in a function definition, is executed as it is encountered.
- It is good programming practice to place all statements into functions, 
  and to specify one function as the starting point.
````
def main():
    result = cubeVolume(2)
    print("A cube with side length 2 has volume", result)
def cubeVolume(sideLength): 
    volume = sideLength ** 3 
    return volume
main()
````
- The cubeVolume function is called from within the main function even though 
  cubeVolume is defined after main.

## Modifying arguments

- In Python, a function can never change the contents of a variable that was passed as an argument.
- Invoking a function with a variable as argument, actually don't pass the variable. It just passes the value that it contains.
- The following function contains a common error: trying to modify an argument.
````
def addTax(price, rate) :
tax = price * rate / 100
price = price + tax # Has no effect outside the function. return tax

Now consider the call:
total = 10
addTax(total, 7.5) # Does not modify total.
````

## Return values

- Every branch of a function should return a value. Consider the following incorrect
  function.
````
def cubeVolume(sideLength): 
    if sideLength >= 0:
        return sideLength ** 3
    # Error—no return value if sideLength < 0
````
- The compiler will not report this as an error. Instead, the special value `None` 
  will be returned from the function.

## Recursive functions

- A recursive function is a function that calls itself.
- If we need a triangle pattern like this recursive functions are used.
````
[]
[][] 
[][][] 
[][][][]
````
- Here is the code for the above pattern generation.
````
def printTriangle(sideLength): 
  if sideLength < 1: 
    return printTriangle(sideLength - 1) 
  print("[]" * sideLength)
````
