# Towers of Hanoi Problem

- The “Towers of Hanoi” puzzle has a board with three pegs and a stack of disks of decreasing
  size, initially on the first peg.
- The goal is to move all disks to the third peg.
  - One disk can be moved at one time, from any peg to any other peg. 
  - Place smaller disks only on top of larger ones, not the other way around.
    
## Algorithm

- Consider the problem of moving d disks from peg p1 to peg p2, where p1 and p2 
  can be any of 1, 2, or 3, and p1 ≠ p2.
- Because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, To get the index of remaining peg p3 = 6 - p1 - p2.
- Now we can move the disks as follows:
  1. Move the top d – 1 disks from p1 to p3
  1. Move one disk (the one on the bottom of the pile of d disks) from p1 to p2
  1. Move the d – 1 disks that were parked on p3 to p2
- From the above procedure we can handle the first and third step recursively, but because 
  we move one fewer disk(d-1), the recursion will eventually terminate.
  
## Solution

- Each disk is represented as an integer indicating its size from 1 to n, the no of disks
  in the puzzle.
- There are three towers, so a configuration of the puzzle is a list of three lists, such 
  as this one:  
```
[[5, 2], [4, 1], [3]]
```  
- The move function carries out the move, then prints the contents of the towers:
```python
def move(towers, disks, fromPeg, toPeg) : 
    if disks > 0 :
        other = 3 - fromPeg - toPeg 
        move(towers, disks - 1, fromPeg, other) 
        diskToMove = towers[fromPeg].pop() 
        towers[toPeg].append(diskToMove) 
        print(towers)
        move(towers, disks - 1, other, toPeg)
```
- Here the index values are 0, 1, 2. Therefore, the index of the other peg is 
  `3 - fromPeg - toPeg`.
- The main function is
```
def main() : 
    NDISKS = 5
    towers = [list(range(1, NDISKS + 1)), [], []] 
    print(towers)
    move(towers, NDISKS, 0, 2)
```
