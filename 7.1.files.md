# Working with files

- To open a file for reading `infile = open("input.txt", "r")`
  - The file must exist, otherwise an exception occurs.  
- To open a file for writing `outfile = open("output.txt", "w")`
  - If the file already exists, it is emptied before writing new text into it.
  - If the file doesn't exist, then an empty file is created.
- It is always recommended closing the file once the processing is done or else
  some output may not be written to disk. For ex, `outfile.close()`
  
## Reading from a file

- To read a line of text from a file: `line = infile.readline()`.
- When a file is opened, an input marker is positioned at the beginning of the file.
- The readline() reads the text, starting at the current position and continuing 
  until the end of the line("\n") is encountered. 
  - The input marker is then moved to the next line. 
  - The readline method returns the text that it read, including the newline 
    character that denotes the end of the line. For example, suppose input.txt 
    contains the lines
````  
flying 
circus
````
- The first call to readline() returns the string "flying\n". 
  - calling readline() a second time, returns the string "circus\n". 
  - Calling readline() again yields the empty string "" because input marker 
    reaches the end of the file.
- If the file contains a blank line, then readline() returns a string containing 
  only the newline character "\n".
- If the file contains numerical data, the strings must be converted. For ex:
  `value = float(line)`
- To read the entire file:  
````
line = infile.readline() 
while line != "" :
    Process the line.
    line = infile.readline()  
````

## Writing to a file

- To write a string to an output file, we need to write newline character also like below:
````
outfile.write("Hello, World!\n")
````
- Formatted strings can be written to a file with the write method:
````  
outfile.write("Number of entries: %d\nTotal: %8.2f\n" % (count, total))
````
- `print` function can be used to write text to a file.
````
print("Hello, World!", file=outfile)

# If new line is not required
print("Total: ", end="", file=outfile)
````

### Backslashes in file names

- When specifying a file name as a string literal, and the name contains backslash 
  characters (as in a Windows file name), add backslash twice:
````  
infile = open("c:\\homework\\input.txt", "r")
````

## Text input and output

- To read all lines of a file there is a simple way:
````
infile = open(inputFileName, "r")
for line in infile: 
  print(line)
````
- The print function prints its argument to the terminal and then starts a new line by printing a newline 
  character. As each line in the input file ends with a newline character, the second newline creates a blank line 
  in the output.
- To remove the newline character use rstrip(): `line = line.rstrip()`
  - rstrip() method removes all tabs, blank spaces and newlines at the end of the line.
  - rstrip(chars) > If provided, characters in the string chars are removed instead of white space.
    For ex: `rstrip(.?)` removes `.` or `?` at the end of the line.
  - s.lstrip() > removes all tabs, blank spaces and newlines at the beginning of the line.
  - s.lstrip(chars)  > removes specified characters.
  - s.strip() > removes all tabs, blank spaces and newlines from both sides.
  - s.strip(chars)  > removes specified characters from both sides.
  
### Reading words

- To read words from a line use split method as: `wordList = line.split()`.
- split() method splits line based on white spaces. If any special characters need to be removed
  from the words, use rstrip() method like below.
````
inputFile = open("lyrics.txt", "r") 
for line in inputFile :
  line = line.rstrip() 
  wordList = line.split() 
  for word in wordList :
    word = word.rstrip(".,?!") 
    print(word)
inputFile.close()
````
- If `:` is the delimiter then: `split(:)`
- If we want only 2 splits from the line: `split(":", 2)`.
- For more examples, refer section 7.2.3 in the book.

### Reading characters

- To read one character from the file `char = inputFile.read(1)`.
  - The above `char` variable type is string. 
  - if no argument is passed, then the whole contents of the file are read into a string.
- To read the file contents
````
while char != "" :
  Process character.
  char = inputFile.read(1)
````

### Reading the entire file

- To read the entire file into a list of strings `listOfLines = inputFile.readlines()`.
- It is better to avoid using readlines() for large files because a large amount of memory 
  to store all the strings may result in out of memory errors.

## Regular expressions

- The regular expression for describing numbers is `[0-9]+`.
- The regular expression for sequence of digits that do not immediately follow letters is
  `'[^A-Za-z][0-9]+'`. `[^A-Za-z]` denotes any characters that are not in the range A-Z and a to z.
- Python has a module `re` for regular expression. Here is an example.
````
from re import split
line = "http://python.org"
regex = "[^A-Za-z]+"
tokens = split(regex, line) # ["http", "python", "org"]
````

## Character encodings

- ASCII defines an encoding for 128 characters.
- ASCII encodes all upper and lowercase Latin letters and digits, as well as symbols 
  such as + * %, as values between 0 and 127. For example, the code for the letter A is 65.
- Unicode was introduced in 1987 to give each character an unique integer value.
- Python picks up the character encoding from the operating system (which in turn 
  depends on the region in which the user lives).
- If you need to process files with accented characters, Chinese characters, or special 
  symbols, request the UTF-8 encoding:
````
infile = open("input.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") 
outfile = open("output.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
````  

## Working with CSV files

### Reading from csv

- Python has `csv` module to deal with csv files.
- To read from a csv file:
````
from csv import reader
infile = open("movies1.csv")
csvReader = reader(infile)
for row in csvReader:
  print(row)
````
- We can skip the row using pythons next() function: `next(csvReader)`.

### Writing to csv

- To write to a CSV file:
````
from csv import writer
outfile = open("newdata.csv", "w")
csvWriter = writer(outfile)
# Header
csvWriter.writerow(["Name", "Id", "Class", "Average"])
# Row
csvWriter.writerow(["John Smith", 1607, "Senior", 3.28])
# To skip a row
csvWriter.writerow([])
````
## Command line arguments

- It is cus- tomary to interpret strings starting with a hyphen (-) as program arguments:
````  
python program.py -v input.dat
````
- The program receives its command line arguments in the argv list defined in the sys module.
  In the above example, the argv list has a length of 3 and contains the strings.
```
argv[0]: "program.py" 
argv[1]: "-v" 
argv[2]: "input.dat"
```

## Working with files and directories

- The `os` module has functions for dealing with files and directories.
- To get the name of the current working directory, use `name = os.getcwd()`.
- To change the directory `os.chdir("reports")`
- To verify if a file/directory exists `os.path.exists(filename) # returns boolean`.
- To return the list of contents of the current directory `contents = os.listdir()`.
- To list contents of other directory `contents = os.listdir("reports")`.
- To verify if the string represents a file `os.path.isfile(filename)`.
- To verify if the string represent a directory `os.path.isdir(filename)`.
- To rename a file `os.rename(source, dest)`.
- To delete an existing file `os.remove(filename)`.
- To return a file name to a directory name including appropriate path seperator 
  `os.path.join(path, name)`.
- To copy from source file to destination file `shutil.copy(source, dest)`.

## Binary Files and Random Access

- There are two fundamentally different ways to store data: in text format or binary format.
- In text format, data items are represented in human-readable form as a sequence of characters.
- In binary form, data items are represented in bytes. A byte is composed of 8 bits, 
  each of which can be 0 or 1. For example, the integer 123,456 can be stored as
  64 226 1 0
````
123,456 = 64 + 226 · 256 + 1 · 256^2 + 0 · 256^3
````
- In python binary calculation happens from left to right unlike other programming languages.

### Reading from binary files

- With a binary file, we can't read strings of text. We can read the individual bytes.
  
````
theBytes = inFile.read(4) # reads first 4 bytes
value = theBytes[0] # To read the first byte

# To read a byte in one call
value = inFile.read(1)[0]
````

### Random access

- To position the marker relative to the beginning of the file `inFile.seek(position)`.
- `SEEK_CUR` is a constant defined `io` module which represents current marker position.
- To get cursor position four bytes from SEEK_CUR `inFile.seek(4, SEEK_CUR)`.
- To get cursor position 3 bytes backwards from SEEK_CUR `inFile.seek(-3, SEEK_CUR)`.
- To get current marker position `position = inFile.tell()`
