# Recursion

- Recursion is a powerful technique for breaking up complex computational problems into 
  simpler ones.
- The term “recursion” refers to the fact that the same computation occurs repeatedly.
- There are some computations that are very difficult to perform without recursion.
- Two conditions need to be fulfilled for a recursive function:
  - Every recursive call must simplify the computation in some way.
  - There must be special cases (sometimes called base cases) to handle the simplest 
    computations directly.

## Thinking recursively

- Let's test whether a sentence is a palindrome.
- A palindrome string is equal to itself when you reverse all characters. For ex:
  - A man, a plan, a canal—Panama!
  - Go hang a salami, I’m a lasagna hog
  - Madam, I’m Adam
- When testing for a palindrome, we ignore the difference between upper and lower case 
  letters, as well as spaces and punctuation marks.

### Step 1

- Consider various ways to simplify input.
  - To Simplify input in this example we may need to remove some characters from the 
    input.
  - Sometimes it is more useful to cut the input into half.
- Several possibilities of simplifying input.
  - Remove the first character.
  - Remove the last character.
  - Remove both the first and last characters.
  - Remove a character from the middle.
  - Cut the string into two halves.

### Step 2
- Combine solutions with simpler inputs into a solution to the original problem.
- We need to imagine that the solution to simpler input is available for this.
- We can turn the solution of the simpler input into a solution to the original input.
- Let's look at the definition of the problem palindrome.
  - A word is palindrome if first and last letters match.
  - The word obtained by removing the first and last letters is also a palindrome.
- Consider various solutions from above step.
  - Cut the string into two halves doesn't seem to be a good idea here.
  - Removing the first and last letters from a word seems to ideal for this.
- We need to look at constraints like inputs which contains empty strings, special 
  characters etc.
- Create the scenarios for various constraints on the input.  
  - If the first and last characters are both letters, then check whether they match. 
    If so, remove both and test the shorter string.
  - Otherwise, if the last character isn’t a letter, remove it and test the shorter string.
  - Otherwise, the first character isn’t a letter. Remove it and test the shorter string.

### Step 3

- Solution to simpler input
- The simplest strings for the palindrome test:
  - Strings with two characters -> We can follow step 2 for this.
  - Strings with a single character -> Single characters are already palindromes.
  - The empty string -> An empty string is also a palindrome.

### Step 4

- Implement solution by following simple case and the reduction step.
```
def isPalindrome(text) :
    length = len(text)
    
    # Separate case for shortest strings. 
    if length <= 1 :
        return True 
    else :
        # Get first and last characters, converted to lowercase. 
        first = text[0].lower()
        last = text[length - 1].lower()
        if first.isalpha() and last.isalpha() : 
            # Both are letters.
            if first == last :
                # Remove both first and last character. 
                shorter = text[1 : length - 1] 
                return isPalindrome(shorter)
            else :
                return False
        elif not last.isalpha() :
            # Remove last character. 
            shorter = text[0 : length - 1] return isPalindrome(shorter)
        else :
            # Remove first character. 
            shorter = text[1 : length] 
            return isPalindrome(shorter)
```
