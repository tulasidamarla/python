# python

- Python is a high level programming language like c, c++ and java.
- It has a much simpler and cleaner syntax than other languages.
- Python is also very portable between computer systems.
- The same Python program will run, without change, on Windows, UNIX, Linux, and Macintosh.

## Writing a simple python program

- Create a new file named hello.py and write the below content

    # My first Python program. 
    print("Hello, World!")

## Executing a program

- A Python program is executed using the Python interpreter.
- The interpreter reads the program and executes all of its steps.
- Open terminal and execute the command `python3 hello.py`.
- If using lower versions of python use `python hello.py`.

## Interactive mode

- The interpreter, also provides an interactive mode in which Python instructions can be entered one at a time.
- To launch the Python interactive mode from a terminal window, enter the command `python3`.
- The interface for working in interactive mode is known as the Python shell.
