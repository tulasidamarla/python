# Sets

- A set is a container that stores a collection of unique values.
- The elements of a set or not stored in any order and cannot be accessed by index.

## Creating and using Sets

- To create a set specify the elements enclosed in braces like below: 
````
cast = { "Luigi", "Gumbys", "Spiny" }
````
- To create a set from a list 
````
names = ["Luigi", "Gumbys", "Spiny"] 
cast = set(names)
````
- To define an empty set use `cast = set()`. Empty braces `{}` defines an empty dictionary which we will see in
  the next section.
- To get the length of the set `noOfElements = len(cast)`.
- To verify if an element is present in the set `if "Luigi" in cast :`.
- To iterate over the set `for character in cast :`.
- To sort the set use `sorted` function: `sorted(cast)`.

## Adding and Removing elements

- To add an element to the set `cast.add("Arthur")`.
  - If an element is not already present in the list, it will be added otherwise no effect on the set.
- To remove an element from a list use one of `discard` or `remove` methods.
````
cast.discard("The Colonel") # Has no impact if element is not present in the list.
cast.remove("The Colonel") # raises an exception if element is not present in the list.
````
- To clear all elements `cast.clear()`.

## Subsets

- A set is a subset of another set if and only if every element of the first set is also an element of the second set.
- The issubset method returns True or False to report whether one set is a subset of another:
````
canadian = { "Red", "White" }
british = { "Red", "Blue", "White" } 
italian = { "Red", "White", "Green" }

if canadian.issubset(british) :
    print("All Canadian flag colors occur in the British flag.")
if not italian.issubset(british) :
    print("At least one of the colors in the Italian flag does not.")
````
- We can test the quality of two sets using the == and != operators.

## Set Union, Intersection, and Difference

- The union of two sets contains all the elements from both sets, with duplicates removed.
````
inEither = british.union(italian) # The set {"Blue", "Green", "White", "Red"}
````
- The union returns new set, it doesn't modify either of the sets.
- The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are in both sets.
````
inBoth = british.intersection(italian)) # The set {"White", "Red"}
````
- The difference of two sets results in a new set that contains those elements in the first set that are not in 
  the second set.
  - The order matters with difference method unlike `union` and `intersection`.
````
print(italian.difference(british)) # Prints {'Green'}
british.difference(italian) # Prints {"Blue"}
````
- When writing a program that manages a collection of unique items, sets are far more 
  efficient than lists.

## Hashing

- Sets can find elements much faster because they are not required to maintain the 
  order of the elements. 
- Python sets use a data structure called a hash table for faster search and retrieval.  
  - Hashtable groups elements based on an integer computed from the element.
  - This is integer is called the `hash` of the element.
  - Here is an interactive session that shows several hash codes:
````
>>> hash(42)
42
>>> hash(4.2) 
461168601842739204
>>> hash("Gumby") 
1811778348220604920
````
- To check whether a value is in a set, one computes hash(value) and then compares 
  the value with those elements that have the same hash code.
  - This way hashing reduces the search limited to only the elements that have same hashcode.
- In Python, you can only form sets from values that can be hashed. Typically, 
  numbers and strings.
- It is not possible to hash a mutable value (such as a list or set).
  - Therefore, you cannot form sets of sets in Python.
  - If we need to collect sequences, use a set of tuples.
